## Overview

This is a simple Todo web application built with ReactJS and Redux.

The point of this project is to help understanding some key ideas of React and Redux:

- Passing data through props
- Lifting state up
- Controlled component
- Styling app using simple CSS
- using connect, reducers, actions in redux

## Todo in making this application:

1. Add todo
2. Display todo
3. Cross off todo
4. Show no. of active todo
5. Filter All/Active/Complete
6. Delete todo
7. Delete all complete
   - Only show if at least one is complete
8. Button to toggle all On/Off

## Features

- Lets you add todo;
- cross off the todo by clicking on todo if task is complete and vice-versa;
- Can delete separate todo by clicking on delete icon;
- Allow user to filter All/Active/Complete todo;
- Show no. of todo left;
- Allow user to delete all complete todos;
- Button available to toggle all complete or active;

## Pre-written readme file by create react app:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
